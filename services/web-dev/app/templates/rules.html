          <p>A challenge is a C source program that contains a function with prototype</p>
          <pre>void AES_128_encrypt(unsigned char ciphertext[16], unsigned char plaintext[16]);</pre>
          <p>
            It implements an AES-128 encryption under some 128-bit key embedded into the code.
            The function <code>AES_128_encrypt(ciphertext, plaintext)</code> takes a 128-bit plaintext block as input (as a pointer on an array of 16 bytes) and writes the corresponding 128-bit ciphertext (as an array of 16 bytes) at the given address.
          </p>
          <p>
            The C language is the one accepted by either GCC 8.2.0 or TCC 0.9.27 with NO additional language dialect options.
            Contestants may freely choose which compiler is to be used when the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> validates the challenge program.
            The source code must be completely portable and re-compilable towards any target architecture.
            In other words, it must be made only of generic C which in particular, excludes the use of inline assembly.
            Note that there is no restriction to a 32-bit architecture as in the first edition of the WhibOx contest.
            Native 64-bit operations are supported by default and contestants may use them as they see fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            No <code>#include</code> or <code>extern</code> is allowed in the source code, and more generally linking to external libraries (even the standard C libraries) is forbidden.
            This is intended to prevent the inclusion of malware in submitted challenges.
            Any attempt to maliciously attack the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> or the computer system of contestants will lead to <span class="text-danger">DISQUALIFICATION</span>.
            In case evidence of malicious code is found in a challenge, contestants are invited to report the issue to the <span class="text-dark">ORGANIZING COMMITTEE</span> directly (whibox.organizing.committee@gmail.com).
            If contestants are suspicious that some challenge program may contain malware, they may run GCC or TCC in docker or a virtual machine, exactly like the server does (using VirtualBox).

            A contestant who posts a new challenge must temporarily reveal the embedded key to the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> for the purpose of verifying the consistency of the challenge program.
            The key is erased from the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> as soon as it has determined whether it is consistent or not with the challenge.
            This is done as follows.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Challenge-key verification procedure</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> uses the <span class="text-dark">REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION</span> of AES-128 to generate a number of random plaintext-ciphertext pairs under the given key.
              The number of pairs is determined by the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> but is at least 1000.
              Once this is done, the key is erased from the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> compiles the challenge program and checks that it complies with the above requirements.
              If not, the challenge is rejected.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each plaintext-ciphertext pair, the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> runs the executable on the plaintext and checks that the output is equal to the ciphertext.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of mismatch, the procedure halts, the challenge program is rejected and the mismatching plaintext-ciphertext pair is returned to the submitting contestant.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> selects a plaintext-ciphertext pair, hashes the plaintext, deletes it from memory and attaches the ciphertext to the challenge for the purpose of <span class="text-dark">INVERSION</span>.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, the challenge program is validated and:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>given a name by the system,</li>
              <li>assigned a <span class="text-dark">PERFORMANCE SCORE</span> (see below)</li>
              <li>declared as <span class="text-dark">STANDING</span>,</li>
              <li>assigned a <span class="text-dark">STRAWBERRY</span> score and a <span class="text-dark">CARROT</span> score both initialized to 0.</li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Programmatic API access to input-output pairs</strong></p>
          <p>
            When accepted, the challenge is published on the website for anyone to download and play with.
            In addition, a small subset of random plaintext-ciphertext pairs is kept by the SYSTEM for later verification of candidate keys.
            The number of pairs is determined by the SYSTEM but is at least 10.
            These pairs can be recovered as a JSON object with the following HTTP request:
          </p>
          <p><code>GET https://whibox.cyber-crypt.com/show/candidate/{id}/testvectors</code></p>

            The performance score of a challenge is measured by the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> when validating its consistency at posting time.
            Challenges with a higher performance score collect <span class="text-dark">STRAWBERRY</span> and <span class="text-dark">CARROT</span> points faster.
            The score is assigned as follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Execution time.</strong>
            The <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> measures the average CPU time consumed by the challenge program and determines the fraction
            \[f_{\text{time}} = \frac{\text{average time}}{1 \text{ second} }\;.\]
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Code size.</strong>

          <p>
            <strong>RAM usage.</strong>
            The <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> measures the average RAM consumption of the executable and determines the fraction

          </p>
          <p>
            The performance score of the challenge is evaluated as

          </p>

            Note that the performance score of a challenge that meets the allowed maximal limits is equal to \(1\).

            Given the submitted key, the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> fetches the recorded plaintext-ciphertext pairs attached to the challenge and uses the <span class="text-dark">AES REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION</span> again to check that the key matches all the pairs.
            The key is erased as soon as the verification is completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case of mismatch, the mismatching pair is returned to the submitting contestant and the break is rejected.
            Otherwise, the submitting contestant is notified that the break is accepted.
            If the challenge was <span class="text-dark">STANDING</span>, it is declared as <span class="text-dark">BROKEN</span> at the time the <span class="text-dark">SYSTEM</span> accepted the break.
          </p>
          <p>Contestants may <span class="text-dark">BREAK</span> challenges until the <span class="text-dark">FINAL DEADLINE</span>.</p>
